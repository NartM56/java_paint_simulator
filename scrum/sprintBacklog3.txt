TYPE     : BUG BUG?.004 : Mowahid : Completed
NAME     : Architecture behind Model is poor
PRIORITY : 3
ESTIMATE : 2 hours    ACTUAL : 3 hours
ISSUE    : Having a list of different types of drawable things in the
           model is cumbersome. In fact, it is currently incorrect, with
           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.
           Consider some design patterns, or change of responsibility
           here.

TYPE     : BUG BUG3.005 : Nicholas : Completed
NAME     : Architecture behind handle and update method in panel is poor
PRIORITY : 3
ESTIMATE : 2 hours    ACTUAL : 4 hours
ISSUE    : Adding a new shape into the handle method in PaintPanel will break
           the 'O' principle in SOLID, which is Open/Closed principle. In this
           case, if we want to add another shape, we would modify the method,
           not extend it. We want to fix it, so that it is extended, not
           modified.
