# User Stories/Bugs (add as appropriate), modify at each Sprint Planning Meeting
# If a USER STORY is large, break it into smaller user stories.
# For example: Draw Circle was split into two user stories US1.010 and US1.011
# 
# For example, the color chooser user story involves: 
# 1 Color chooser UI (which could be a USER STORY)
# 2 Implementation of selected color into the drawing stream.
# 
# The naming convention is USs.stp s is the sprint number this user story
# appears in. s is the sprint that introduced the user story, 
# t is a topic number, and p is the parts that the topic is
# divided into (for larger user stories).
#
# Please change the status of the user story/bug to 
#     NotStarted,InProgress, Incomplete,Complete
# as appropriate.
